    A Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and enhance the efficiency of hospital operations. It serves as a centralized platform to manage various aspects of healthcare institutions.
    The system facilitates seamless communication and information flow among different departments within the hospital, including patient registration, billing, pharmacy, laboratory, and more. It aims to improve overall patient care and administration.
    HMS assists in automating routine tasks, reducing paperwork, and minimizing errors, thereby increasing the overall productivity of healthcare professionals. Through electronic health records (EHR), it enables easy access to patient data, ensuring accurate and timely decision-making.
    Appointment scheduling and management are simplified, allowing patients to book appointments online, reducing waiting times and enhancing the overall patient experience.
